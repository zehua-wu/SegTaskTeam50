data/: Contains modules for data loading, supporting custom dataset preprocessing and splitting.
models/: Module for defining models, currently implementing DeepLabV3 with potential for extending other models.
utils/: Provides helper utility functions to simplify common operations.
configs/: Configuration file for managing hyperparameters and paths.
train.py: Training script integrating data loading, model definition, training loop, and result saving.
requirements.txt: Python dependencies required for the project.
Clone the Repository
Use the following command to clone the specific branch branch6:


branch_name="branch6"
repo_url="https://github.com/zehua-wu/SegTaskTeam50.git"
!git clone -b ${branch_name} ${repo_url}
Environment Setup
It is recommended to use Google Colab for running the project and mount Google Drive to save training results. Use the following command to mount Drive:


from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Install Dependencies
Run the following command in the cloned project directory to install all required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Train the Model
Ensure the dataset is prepared and stored in the specified directory.
Configure the configs/config.py file to adjust hyperparameters and paths.
Run train.py to start training:

python train.py
Data Loading Module
data/dataset.py provides a flexible data loading mechanism and supports extending preprocessing pipelines for custom datasets.

Model Definition
models/deeplabv3.py defines the DeepLabV3 model architecture. It supports flexible backbone replacement and customization.

Configuration File
configs/config.py centralizes the management of hyperparameters and project settings, including:

Learning rate
Batch size
Model save paths, etc.
